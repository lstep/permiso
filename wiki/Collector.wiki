This page is about the permiso.collector module

= Introduction =

The `permiso.collector` module is the link between the firewall and the `permiso.identity` module. The collector gets its information from the `NF_QUEUE` or `IP_QUEUE` iptable module and then sends it using PB to the Identity module where it will be checked against the internal database.

= Requirements =

You must be on a Linux system, with iptables compiled in the kernel (or as a module). You must have support for `IP_QUEUE` (old kernels) or NF_QUEUE (newer kernels).
The Collector uses the [http://woozle.org/~neale/src/ipqueue/ ipqueue] python module or the [http://woozle.org/~neale/src/ipqueue/ nfqueue] python module.
They are not installable using `easy_install`, so you'll need to download them and install them (gcc is required).
